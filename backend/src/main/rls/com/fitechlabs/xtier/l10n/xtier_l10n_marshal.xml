    L10n XML file consists of properties.
    *************************************
    
    .NET implementation makes the best effort to convert Java formatting rules to
    format acceptable by .NET String.format(...) method. 
    
    ****************************************************************************************
    * NOTE THAT THIS DOES NOT GUARANTY THAT JAVA AND .NET FORMATTINGS WILL PRODUCE THE     *
    * SAME RESULT. L10N SERVICE ONLY MAKES AN EFFORT TO CONVERT THE FORMATTING TO THE BEST *
    * MATCH FROM THE DIFFERENT PLATFORM.                                                   *
    ****************************************************************************************
        
    The formatting works in the following way:
    
    N - index of the argument
    other - any string
        
        JAVA                        Auto .NET conversion
        ====                        ====================
        
        {N}                         {N}
        
        {N, number}                 {N:G}
        {N, number, integer}        {N:D}
        {N, number, percent}        {N:P}
        {N, number, currency}       {N:C}
        {N, number, other}          {N:other}
        
        {N, date}                   {N:D}
        {N, date, short}            {N:d}
        {N, date, medium}           {N:d}
        {N, date, long}             {N:D}
        {N, date, full}             {N:G}
        {N, date, other}            {N:other}
        
        {N, time}                   {N:T}
        {N, time, short}            {N,t}
        {N, time, medium}           {N,t}
        {N, time, long}             {N,T}
        {N, time, full}             {N,g}
        {N, time, other}            {N, other}

    Naming conventions.
    ===================
    All L10n properties must be named according to the following BNF grammar:
    name:   sub-name
            | name '.' sub-name
            ;
            
    sub-name: [A-Z0-9]
            ;
    
    Notice using '.' for separating sub names. Common sub names should appear first in the name 
    followed by more specific sub names. For example, "CORE.CACHE.MISS.ERR1" would mean cache-miss 
    error message in core subsystem.
